## Summary
This plugin extends [Indigo](http://www.indigodomo.com) allowing it to send messages to [Slack](https://slack.com), optionally with attachments and file upload.  This is a partial re-write of [Slack-Notify](https://github.com/achterberg/slack-notify) by [achterberg](https://github.com/achterberg).

Some notable changes:
* Channel and user lookups are moved to Plugin startup (instead of at each dialog screen).  A menu option has been added to refresh this data as needed.
* Added option for conditional channel mentions (@channel) when posting a message
* Added separate action for file uploads
* Recursive variable substitution



## Requirements
* [Indigo 7](http://www.indigodomo.com/index.html) or later (pro version only)
* A Slack Team is required. Register for an account at [Slack](https://slack.com) and set up a team
* Optional: Create a Slack channel to be used for Slack Notify (recommended), or use one of the defaults

## Installation

* Unzip the file if it doesn't automatically unzip

## Back-end info
* The plugin uses the Slack incoming webhook integration [API](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).
* The plugin will attempt to get your user information from Slack to fill in the channels available in your team and to retrieve your username. Turning on debugging mode will expose your Slack user credentials (including ID, username, user icon, user color, real name, status and email address) in the Indigo log.
* The plugin will attempt to get your [gravatar](http://gravatar.com) using your Slack email address if a Slack icon does not exist.
